#+title: Context Activity

What paths of the store are accessed most commonly?


* context_activity.ml

Measures (coarsley) how many times a path is accessed with a ~Context.find_tree~, ~Context.mem~, or ~Context.find~ operation within the first 1000 blocks of the trace.

Most reads access very few paths.

See [[./context_activity.out]] for full output.

What are the significances of these paths? Would it make sense to have specialized indices for these hot paths?

Seems like the way stuff is stored in the context is defined by ~storage_functors.ml~ in the ~tezos-protocol-015-PtLimaPt.environment~ library.
